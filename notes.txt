Discussion Points:

1. What are your thoughts on the concurrency? If telemetry is used in multi-threaded environment, ensure thread safety, especially for Posthog and Sentry clients

2. Should we add a `flush` method to explicitly send batched events/errors to PostHog/Sentry?

3. What is the difference between sentry and sentry_dsn

4. Regarding the `instance_id` of `TelemetryConfig` struct why do we need a `instance_id`, how do we intend to use it? I thought the telemetry permission if given would be persistent 
and not sessions-based. The user would obviously have the option to opt-out of telemetry but that option have to be explicity stated by the user. The telemetry does not shut down by default after every session
